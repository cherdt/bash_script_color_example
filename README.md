Example Bash script with output colors
======================================


I've written a zillion Bash scripts but I've never modified the color of the output before! What fun. And possibly useful.

Adding this here so I remember how to do it again later.

Usage:

    ./colors.sh


You might need to add the execute bit:

    chmod +x colors.sh
